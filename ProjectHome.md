# Aurora Road Network Modeler #

**Aurora Road Network Modeler (RNM)** is a set of tools for operational planning and management of travel corridors (road networks comprised of freeways and surrounding urban arterials) and analysis of their performance. It is based on the _Aurora Object-Oriented Framework for Simulation and Analysis of Flow Networks_ and is implemented in Java.

Currently, **Aurora RNM** consists of three modules.

Traffic flow and density are computed using the macroscopic Cell Transmission Model. It also computes such traffic characteristics as speed, VMT, VHT, delay and productivity loss and generates flow, density and speed contour plots making it convenient to compare with the real traffic data collected by systems such as [PeMS](http://pems.eecs.berkeley.edu). The user can create simulation scenarios by means of events that change user-specified configuration parameters of the road network at user-specified times.|

It can be used to build road networks from scratch; edit existing road networks by deleting or reassigning network components or adding new network components; efficiently provision road parameters such as fundamental diagrams and split ratios; and input demand profiles.|

This configuration file can be refined in the Configurator and then used by the Simulator. It is recommended to use GIS Importer together with the open source [OpenJUMP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot) software used for geometric filtering of GIS data.|
